      <p>Thank you for visiting my page! I am a seasoned Systems Support Specialist with 13 years work experience in the Property Management Industry.</p>

      <p>I have been working the ticket queue in addtion to large projects for over 2 years now and my current bread and butter is Yardi. I have worked with this property management software from both the enduser experience and from the backend for both single and multi-family companies.</p>

      <p>As I take the next step into advancing my technical career, I have the loving support of my wonderful husband and daughter who are my motivation. Some of my hobbies are traveling to the beach or nearby lakes and rivers and working on my new house and of course spending time with friends and family.</p>
